# qp-stickynote

This is a simple sticky note resource that was converted to *ESX* from *QBCore* & made compatible with [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory) *only*. This allows you to write things down on a item, and when giving the item to another person the text you wrote will be displayed to them. Thanks to [ExtremeGamingUK](https://github.com/ExtremeGamingUK), this was initially a fork of his notepad.
